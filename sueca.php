				<p>
					The card game that is so popular among Portuguese-speaking countries.
					Two teams of two players (allies sitting across from each other) divide a deck of cards
					among them and try to capture the most points for their team.
				</p>
				<p>
					Team up with your ally: they'll give you more points of the suit you played or protect
					your play from the other team's attacks, using an ever-improving Artificial Intelligence
					developed from scratch by Epic Vortex, exclusively for Sueca.
				</p>
				<p>
					Surprise your opponents with clearly marked gold trump cards that allow you to steal their
					points if you have no cards of the played suit.
				</p>

				<p>Features include:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Rules page that teaches you how to play the game</li>
					<li>Invalid plays are dimmed to help you identify the valid cards easily</li>
					<li>Trumps for the current game show up as gold cards</li>
					<li>Two different visual themes</li>
					<li>Different options for many Sueca variants</li>
					<li>Google Play achievements</li>
				</ul>
